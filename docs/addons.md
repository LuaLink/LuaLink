# LuaLink Documentation
The project is in an experimental state, so is the documentation - expect things to change quite often.

For new Lua users, [this community-contributed documentation](https://devdocs.io/lua~5.2-language/) may help you to get started.

# Addons
Addons extend Lua scripting capabilities by adding custom variables and functions.

<br />

### Usage Example
Addons are distributed as `.jar` files and should be placed inside your server's `plugins` directory.
```lua
-- Getting addon instance.
local MiniPlaceholders = addons.get("MiniPlaceholders")

-- Retrieving global placeholders,
local globalPlaceholders = MiniPlaceholders.getGlobalPlaceHolders()
```
In this example, we are getting instance of `MiniPlaceholders` addon provided by [LuaLink-MiniPlaceholders](https://github.com/LuaLink/LuaLink-MiniPlaceholders), and using it to retrieve global placeholders. Of course, different addons serve different purposes, some may expose plugins' API, while others may add utility functions.

<br />
